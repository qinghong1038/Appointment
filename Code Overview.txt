  Primary idea:
  Take in Username, Password and handle user aunthentication.
  Once a user has been verified, pre-load the particular user's autocomplete data, appointment history.
  Handle a "Forgot Password?" option provided to the users.
  
  Alternative idea:
  Have an option to choose between "New" and "Existing" users.
  Use phone numbers and OTPs to authenticate users rather than username and passwords.
